# RHTAP

## What is RHTAP?
**Red Hat Trusted Application Pipeline** is a managed service that helps developers build secure cloud applications quickly. It lets you:

- Set up applications in seconds using Red Hat templates
- Create container images that can be deployed to Kubernetes environments
- Get strong security features built-in, including code scanning and vulnerability detection
- Generate documentation (called [SBOMs](https://www.cisa.gov/sbom#:~:text=A%20%E2%80%9Csoftware%20bill%20of%20materials,that%20make%20up%20software%20components.)) that tracks everything used in your application
- Customize your build process while keeping security tight
- Automate everything through GitHub, so new code updates trigger automatic builds and security checks

The big advantage is that it combines security, automation, and simplicity. It meets high security standards ([SLSA](https://slsa.dev/spec/v1.0/about) level 3) without developers needing to set up complex security systems themselves. 

The entire pipeline travels with your code as configuration, making it easier to maintain.
